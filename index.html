Myself
- My native language is English but I am also fluent in Mandarin.
- I'm a working adult so sometimes I may be inactive.
- KJW < My Age < LTY
- I love art, music, and film.
- I enjoy listening to jazz, r&b and classical music. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mayuradio&src=typed_query&f=live">#mayuradio</a> for daily music recs
- My DMs are always open if you want to talk or need help in anything.

Before you follow
- 85% tweets = NCT, 10% = personal/other, 5% = youtube/spotify links
- I'm not a solo stan. I tweet about all 127 members especially my top six.
- I am very interactive and chatty.
- I selectively followback. If you bias the same people as me and you primarily tweet in English, I'll probably followback right away.

If you're here for other reasons:
- If I have blocked you, it might be through a block chain. If you want to be unblocked, use another person to reach me. I block specific fandoms and akgae.
