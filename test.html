<h1>Myself</h1>
- My native language is English but I am also fluent in Mandarin. <br>
- I'm a working adult so sometimes I may be inactive.<br>
- KJW < My Age < LTY<br>
- I love art, music, and film.<br>
- I enjoy listening to jazz, r&b and classical music. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mayuradio&src=typed_query&f=live">#mayuradio</a> for daily music recs<br>
- My DMs are always open if you want to talk or need help in anything.<br>
<p>
<h1>Before you follow</h1>
- 85% tweets = NCT, 10% = personal/other, 5% = youtube/spotify links<br>
- I'm not a solo stan. I tweet about all 127 members especially my top six.<br>
- I am very interactive and chatty.<br>
- I selectively followback. If you bias the same people as me and you primarily tweet in English, I'll probably followback right away.<br>
<p>
<h1>If you're here for other reasons:</h1>
- If I have blocked you, it might be through a block chain. If you want to be unblocked, use another person to reach me. I block specific fandoms and akgae.
